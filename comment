Hi, i'm form team Viettel , which belong to a company have contributed to openstack.
We plant to monitor our cloud product system by TICK.
I want to join in writing this plugin, contact with me by email hoanq13@viettel.com.vn.
I'm have experience in manage openstack, but I'm new in golang and write telegraf plugin too, please guide me what to do of the coding.

Current, i recommend monitor:
- neutron: floating IP (free, total, unused,) IP pool of another network 
- openstack agent status.
In configuration, you should put:
- RAM, CPU, DISK overcommit ratio . for counting resources remain.
- Cloudname tag, when data go to infllux we want to know which cloud that metric form.
- Support https.

Best regards, hope it can run monitor the Product system soon :-)
